As I start on my trek of the web developer program, I find that like baking cookies, coding requires an exactness I have not encountered before. In the beginning of this year, I made a goal to try and make a different type of cookie every week. We had chocolate chip cookies, lemon glazed cookies, sugar cookies, and ginger snaps. One thing I discovered in this process:

Learning how to bake cookies is NOT easy. The standard? Follow the instructions to a T and you'll have a delicious dessert. Simple, yes?

No, not when it comes to cookies. I have found that it is a complicated process that if not done absolutely perfectly, the cookies won't work. You could make the same argument for other baked goods, but you can indeed follow those directions and get a fantastic result. Cookies are another story. What does "mix ingredients until the batter just comes together" actually mean? I had moments where I dreamed I'd meet Martha Stewart at a bar and after a few drinks I could look her in the eye and ask "What is your problem?"

When I'm elbow deep into a program with a lab, I find myself thinking about my cookie failures. Remembering that I mixed my ingredients too much and I had rock hard treats for my husband to try. Every time I run a new line of code and see my errors get closer to passing, I feel a double glimmer of hope with these earlier memories in mind. It's clear to me that as I practice my coding, I'll get faster, more efficient, and more successful with each program I create. 

Eventually my methods will come together just right on the first try (or group of first tries). Eventually the exactness of my loops and iterations will be almost as sweet as perfectly made cookies.
